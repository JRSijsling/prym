This directory contains code to compute period lattices of modular curves. It requires a SageMath installation.

Usage:
load("Periods.sage")
GammaHPeriods(N,H,prec)
where N is the level, prec is the requested number of decimal digits, and H is as follows:
* H = 0 : Compute periods for the modular curve X0(N) attached to the congruence subgroup Gamma0(N) = { [a,b;c,d] in SL(2,Z) | c=0 mod N}
* H = 1 : Compute periods for the modular curve X1(N) attached to the congruence subgroup Gamma1(N) = { [a,b;c,d] in SL(2,Z) | c=0 mod N, a=d=1 mod N}
* H = a vector S of integers coprime to N : Compute periods for the modular curve X_H(N) attached to the congruence subgroup GammaH(N) = { [a,b;c,d] in SL(2,Z) | a,d mod N in H, c=0 mod N}, where H is the subroup of (Z/NZ)* generated by S.

No exact claim on the accuracy of the result is made, but almost all the decimals of the output should be correct.

Caveat: At the moment, the code will fail on "small" cases where X0(N) is of genus 1 or less (that is to say is dim S_2(Gamma0(N)) < 2). Contact Nicolas (mascotn@tcd.ie) if you would like the code to be amended to handle such "small" cases.
